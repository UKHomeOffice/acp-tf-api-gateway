# DEPLOYMENTS - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/api_gateway_deployment
# Manages an API Gateway REST Deployment. A deployment is a snapshot of the REST API configuration. 
# The deployment can then be published to callable endpoints via the aws_api_gateway_stage resource and optionally managed further with the aws_api_gateway_base_path_mapping resource, aws_api_gateway_domain_name resource, and aws_api_method_settings resource. 
# For more information, see the API Gateway Developer Guide.

# https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/api_gateway_stage   < - STAGES
# a main stage? for each account with a var.environment appeneded to the stage name?

# method response? integration response?
